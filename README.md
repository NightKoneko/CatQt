# CatQt
 Just a silly little test program I made with Qt

# How to Use:
 Run the .exe and it should work 
 (Tested only on newest version of Windows 10, so I don't know if it works on other platforms)

# Requirements (?)
 You might need Qt for it to work, I honestly don't fully know. If you are building from source though, probably need Qt and Qt Creator to compile and build it
